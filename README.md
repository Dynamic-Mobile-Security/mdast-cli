## Install options

### DockerHub
You can run this script using [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mobilesecurity/mdast_cli):

`docker pull mobilesecurity/mdast_cli:latest`

### From PyPi

It is possible to install a package using pip:

`pip install mdast_cli`

With this method, it is possible to start scanning without specifying the `python` interpreter using the` mdast_cli` command, for example:

`mdast_cli -h`

All examples below will use exactly this approach.

### Source

It also supports launching by loading source files and launching the main script directly:

`python3 mdast_cli/mdast_scan.py -h`

With this method of launching, you must additionally install the packages specified in `requirements.txt`


## Launch options

Currently, several distribution systems are supported:
 * Local file
 * Applications from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps)
 * Applications from [Appstore](https://www.apple.com/app-store/)
 * Applications from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
 * Applications from [AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms)
 * Applications from [Nexus Repository 3.x](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3) from maven repo.
 * Applications from [Nexus2](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager2)
 * Applications from [Rustore](https://rustore.ru/)
 * Applications from [Appgallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/)
 * Applications from [Rumarket](https://ruplay.market/apps/)

## Launch parameters

#### Download only

If you just want to download the application without scanning, specify `--download_only` or `-d`  
After that you will need to specify the distribution system and mandatory parameters for specified system

* `distribution_system` - distribution method for the application   
_possible values_ `file`/`google_play`/`appstore`/`firebase`/`appcenter`/`nexus`/`nexus2`/`rustore`/`appgallery`/`rumarket`
For detailed information refer to the respective sections below.

If you want to integrate security analysis of downloaded application in the CI/CD you should specify these parameters.  

#### Scan parameters

The launch options depend on the location of the apk file sent for analysis. Also, there are parameters that must be specified for launch:

Required parameters:
 * `url` - network address for system (the path to the root without the final /)
 * `token` - CI/CD access token (refer to our documentation for ways to retrieve the token)
 * `company_id` - identifier of the company within which the scan will be performed

Optional parameters:
 * `project_id` - optional parameter, ID of the project for scan, Use only if you want to autocreate profile in existing project
 * `profile_id` - optional parameter, ID of the profile to be analyzed, If not set - profile will be created automatically
 * `testcase_id` - ID of the test case to be executed. This is an optional parameter, if not set - manual scan with 20 seconds delay until finish will be executed;
 * `appium_script_path` - path to appium script to be executed for autoscan via appium.
 * `architecture_id` - optional parameter, identifier of the operating system architecture on which the scan will be performed. If not set - architecture will be selected automatically (Android 11/iOS 14)
 * `nowait` - an optional parameter specifying whether to wait for the scan to complete. If this flag is set, the script will not wait for the scan to complete but will exit immediately after starting. If the flag is not selected, the script will wait for the completion of the analysis process and generate a report.
 * `summary_report_json_file_name` - an optional parameter defining the name of the json file into which the scanning information in json format is uploaded. If the parameter is absent, the information will not be saved.
 * `pdf_report_file_name` - an optional parameter that specifies the name of the pdf file into which information on scanning in pdf format is uploaded. If the parameter is absent, the report will not be saved.
 * `download_path` - an optional parameter that specifies the path to folder with downloaded apps. Default value: *downloaded_apps*
 * `long_wait` - increase wait time for scan to 1 week, boolean parameter

## Distribution systems

### Local file launch

#### Parameters

This type of launch implies that the application file is located locally.
To select this method at startup, you must specify the parameter `distribution_system file`.  
In this case, the required parameter must specify the path to the file: `file_path`

#### Launch example

__Docker launch__  
After pulling run docker using command like this (all parameters are applied due to distribution_system choice):

```
docker run -it -v {path_to_folder_with_application}:/mdast/files -v {path_to_report_folder}:/mdast/report mobilesecurity/mdast_cli:latest --profile_id 1 --architecture_id 5 --testcase_id 4 --distribution_system file --file_path /mdast/files/{application_file_name} --url "https://saas.mobile.appsec.world" --company_id 1 --token eyJ0eXA4OiJKA1Q**********U4I1NiJ1 --summary_report_json_file_name /mdast/report/json-report.json --pdf_report_file_name /mdast/report/pdf-report.pdf
```

Where:
 * `{path_to_folder_with_application}` - absolute path to the folder where build application locating
 * `{path_to_report_folder}` - absolute path to the folder where reports will be generated
 * `{application_file_name}` - full name of the built apk inside the `{path_to_folder_with_application}` folder


__Standard launch method__
```
mdast_cli --distribution_system file --file_path "/files/demo/apk/demo.apk" --url "https://saas.mobile.appsec.world" --profile_id 1 --testcase_id 4 --company_id 1 - architecture_id 1 --token "eyJ0eXA4Oi**************I1NiJ1.eyJzdaJqZWNcX**************8OTU3MjB1.hrI6c4VN_U2mo5VjHvRoENPv2"
```

As a result, automated analysis of the `demo.apk` application with a profile with` id` 1 will be launched and a test case with `id` 4 will be launched.

__Start without waiting for the scan to complete__
```
mdast_cli --distribution_system file --file_path "/files/demo/apk/demo.apk" --url "https://saas.mobile.appsec.world" --profile_id 1 --testcase_id 4 --company_id 1 - architecture_id 1 --token "eyJ0eXA4Oi**************I1NiJ1.eyJzdaJqZWNcX**************8OTU3MjB1.hrI6c4VN_U2mo5VjHvRoENPv2"
```
As a result, automated analysis of the `demo.apk` application with a profile with` id` 1 will be launched and a test case with `id` 4 will be launched and the script will finish immediately after starting the scan and will not wait for the end and generate a report.

__Generating a Summary report in JSON format__
```
mdast_cli --distribution_system file --file_path "/files/demo/apk/demo.apk" --url "https://saas.mobile.appsec.world" --profile_id 1 --testcase_id 4 --company_id 1 - architecture_id 1 --token "eyJ0eXA4Oi**************I1NiJ1.eyJzdaJqZWNcX**************8OTU3MjB1.hrI6c4VN_U2mo5VjHvRoENPv2" --summary_report_json_file_name json-scan-report.json
```
As a result, automated analysis of the `demo.apk` application with a profile with` id` 1 will be launched and a test case with `id` 4 will be launched, and upon completion of scanning, a JSON report with the total number of defects and brief statistics will be saved.

### Google play

To download application from Google Play Store you need **temporary account with 2fa authentication disabled**.  

You should specify the package name of the application you want to download, you can get it directly from the Google Play app page or any other way.


Also, you need to select the `distribution_system google_play`.  

During the initial launch of the script you should specify the mandatory parameters: email + password, after that the application will not be downloaded if you don't specify optional parameter `google_play_download_with_creds` and the scan will not run, but you will **receive gsfid and token** for google authentication, which you should use later on for the successful Google Play application scan.  

#### Parameters
 * `google_play_package_name` - package name of application you want to download
 * `google_play_email` - email of your Google account for first login only
 * `google_play_password` - password of your Google account for login only

You can download app while logging in by email and password with an optional parameter:

 * `google_play_download_with_creds` - app will be downloaded during initial login  


At the initial run of the script you will get the **gsfId** and **auth token** in the script logs, you should copy and save them. They are required for stable and successful execution of the script afterwards.

![gsfid_token_logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46852358/162791052-fbce7121-1430-49ca-a9b9-68997391abd6.png)  

Using these parameters you will have all parameters for successful downloading applications from Google Play Store:

 * `google_play_package_name` - package name of application you want to download
 * `google_play_gsfid` - The Google Services Framework Identifier (GSF ID)
 * `google_play_auth_token` - Google auth token for access to Google Play API

If your app is published in **split apk format** you will get a zip archive with all splits, that can be used for DAST analysis.

You can also specify downloaded app file name with an optional parameter

 * `google_play_file_name` - file name for app to be saved with  

You should use either email + pass ("--google_play_email" + "--google_play_password") or gsfid + token ("--google_play_gsfid" + "google_play_auth_token") arguments for mdast_cli script. For the continuous process you need only gsfid and token.

For successful launch of Google Play integration you should use python 3.8 or 3.9.
#### Launch example

To start the initial login for Google Play, you need to run the following command:
```
mdast_cli -d --distribution_system google_play --google_play_package_name com.instagram.android --google_play_email download*******ly@gmail.com --google_play_password Paaswoord
```
To start the manual scan analysis of the application from Google Play, you need to run the following command:

```
 python mdast_cli/mdast_scan.py --profile_id 1337 --architecture_id 1 --distribution_system google_play --url "https://saas.mobile.appsec.world" --company_id 1 --token 5d5f6c98*********487a68ee20d4562d9f --google_play_package_name com.instagram.android --google_play_gsfid 432******************43 --google_play_auth_token JAgw_2h*************************************8KRaYQ. --google_play_file_name best_apk_d0wnl04d3r
```

As a result in the `downloaded_apps` repository will be application with name `best_apk_d0wnl04d3r.apk` and manual scan will be started.

### AppStore
To download application from AppStore you need to know application_id and have **iTunes account** and credentials for it: email and password with 2FA code.  


You need to select the `--distribution_system appstore` and specify mandatory parameters.


To successfully sign in to iTunes, you will need to **obtain and save** the 2fa code for later use.  
When you run the script for the first time, use your email and password, you will get a login error in the console and at this point a two-factor authentication code will come to your device  


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46852358/153638449-6488cf6d-214f-44cb-8265-fe8b79b2614f.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>  



For the subsequent work of the script without repeating the step with the manual receipt of 2fa code you need to remember the received code, the session with it will be active for 6 months. After that, try to repeat the login with  password and 2FA, formatting it like `password2FA`. You do not need to get new 2fa codes later, this parameter will work for 6 months.   

For example, password is `P@ssword` and 2FA is `742877`, so your parameter `--appstore_password2FA P@ssword742877`.

To get the app_id, go to the app page in the AppStore in your browser, you can extract the required parameter from the url:
![app_id_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46852358/153639003-f121273a-41ac-415d-aad7-6b2789f77cee.png)  

`appstore_app_id 398129933` in this example.  

#### Parameters

 You need to select the `distribution_system appstore` and specify the following mandatory parameters:
* `appstore_bundle_id` or `appstore_app_id`
  * `appstore_bundle_id` - bundle id of application
  * `appstore_app_id` - Application id from AppStore, you can get it on app page from url,   
format: apps.apple.com/app/id{appstore_app_id}
* `appstore_apple_id` - Your email for iTunes login.
* `appstore_password` - Your password for iTunes login
* `appstore_2FA` - Your 2FA code for iTunes login

**Deprecated parameter, will be removed on 01.05.2023:**
* `appstore_password2FA` - Your password and 2FA code for iTunes login, format: password2FA_code, instead of --appstore_password and --appstore_2FA

You can specify downloaded app file name with an optional parameter

 * `appstore_file_name` - file name for app to be saved with

#### Launch example

To start the manual scan analysis of the application from AppStore, you need to run the following command:
```
 python mdast_cli/mdast_scan.py --architecture_id 3 --profile_id 1246 --distribution_system appstore --appstore_app_id 564177498 --appstore_apple_id ubet******@icloud.com --appstore_password pass******* --appstore_2FA 123456  --url "https://saas.mobile.appsec.world" --company_id 2 --token 5d5f6****************2d9f --appstore_file_name my_b3st_4pp
```
As a result in the `downloaded_apps` repository will be application with name `my_b3st_4pp.ipa` and manual scan will be started.

#### Details

If you lost the 2fa code and the login has already been made, the session will be active for a few time without using 2fa, only apple_id + password. You also will not be able to end your session via this script, so for the script to work correctly you need to login again after session expires and save the two-factor authentication code in your notes.  

If there is an error associated with the wrong Apple ID when you start scanning:

![wrong_apple_id](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46852358/158440208-45868069-d772-4476-a1bf-6508c2bac1eb.jpg)   

or error in logs:

"Logging in to the App Store. To open app, log in with the Apple ID with which you made the purchase."

Then contact the support team to agree on an Apple ID, which will be used for AppStore integration, you will be offered a solution to this problem.

While creating AppStore integration [ipatool](https://github.com/majd/ipatool) helped a lot, huge thanks for everyone who contributed to this nice open-source tool.

### Firebase
To download the application latest release from firebase platform you need to know project_number, app_id, app_code, api_key and file_extension parameters from firebase project.  
You need to select the `--distribution_system firebase` and specify following mandatory parameters.  

 * `firebase_project_number` - project number of your Firebase project
 * `firebase_app_id` - application id
 * `firebase_account_json_path` - path to json key file that contains the credentials for the service account.
 * `firebase_app_extension` - your app extension, it can be `apk` for android and `ipa` for iOS

You can specify the downloaded app file name with an optional parameter

 * `firebase_file_name` - file name for app to be saved with

To find `project_number` from Firebase homepage(https://console.firebase.google.com/project/PROJECT_NAME/overview) go to `Project overview -> settings image ->Project settings` In general tab there will be project number in integer format.

To find `app_id` scroll down to 'Your apps'. There will be your app id.

You'll need to obtain an json file that can be used to authenticate request. To do so, you'll need to use a Service Account. A Service Account is a special type of account that is used by applications and services to access Google APIs. To create a Service Account, go to the `GCP Console` and navigate to the `IAM & admin > Service accounts` page. You should enable `scope /auth/cloud-platform` to this account. From there, you can create a new Service Account and download a JSON key file that contains the credentials for the account.

Once you have a Service Account, you can use it to download apps from Firebase via mdast_cli. 

#### Launch example

To start the manual scan analysis of the application, that was downloaded from Firebase, you need to run the following command:
```
python mdast_cli/mdast_scan.py -d --distribution_system firebase --firebase_project_number 1231231337 --firebase_app_id 1:1337:android:123123 --firebase_account_json_path service_acc0unt_file.json --firebase_file_extension apk --firebase_file_name b3st_app
```
As a result in the `downloaded_apps` repository will be application with name `b3st_app.apk`.
